#' Apply the Choi algorithm
#'
#' The Choi algorithm detects periods of non-wear from an ActiGraph device. Such intervals are likely to represent invalid data and therefore should be excluded from downstream analysis.
#' @param agdb A \code{tibble} (\code{tbl}) of activity data with an \code{epochlength} attribute.
#' @inheritParams apply_troiano
#' @param min_period_len Minimum number of consecutive "zero" epochs to start a non-wear period. The default is 90.
#' @param min_window_len The minimum number of consecutive "zero" epochs immediately preceding and following a spike of artifactual movement. The default is 30.
#' @details
#' The Choi algorithm extends the Troiano algorithm by requiring that short spikes of artifactual movement during a non-wear period are preceded and followed by \code{min_window_len} consecutive "zero" epochs.
#'
#' The Choi algorithm is designed for an epoch length of 60 seconds. As such, this function collapses data to a 60 second epoch if required. Epoch lengths greater than 60s are not supported.
#' @return A summary \code{tibble} of the detected non-wear periods. If the activity data is grouped, then non-wear periods are detected separately for each group.
