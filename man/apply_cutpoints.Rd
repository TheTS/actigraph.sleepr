\title{Apply "cutpoints" to physical activity data}
\usage{
apply_cutpoints(agdb, cutpoints, use_magnitude = FALSE,
  custom_cutpoints = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{agdb}{A \code{tibble} of activity data optained from \code{\link{read_agd}}.}

\item{cutpoints}{A set of cutpoints to use. This can one of several predefined strings, or a custom list (see below).}

\item{use_magnitude}{Logical. If true, the vector magnitude is used to measure activity intensity; otherwise the axis1 value is used. The default is \code{FALSE}. Note that several predifined cutpoints will override the default (e.g. 'freedson_adult_vm').}

\item{custom_cutpoints}{A list of custom cutpoints. This must be a list containing two vectors. The first contains count threshold ranges (must be an even number), and the second contains a list of category names. These names are used as column names when using \code{\link{summarise_agd}}.See below for an example.}
}
\value{
The input \code{tibble} of activity data with an additional \emph{'activity'} column. The cutpoint information is appended to the tibble attributes.
}
\description{
Each epoch is assigned to an intensity category based on a set of "cutpoints".
}
\details{
All cutpoint values must be at the counts-per-minute (CPM) scale (60 sec epoch). However, you can still apply a set of cutpoints to data that has an \code{epochlength} of less that 60 seconds (the function adjusts the CPM values based on the \code{epochlength} attribute). The six sets of predefined cutpoints are:
\itemize{\item freedson_adult (1998)
         \item freedson_adult_vm (2011)
         \item freedson_children (2005)
         \item evenson_children (2008)
         \item mattocks_children (2007)
         \item puyau_children (2002)
         }
}
\examples{
data("gtxplus1day")

# Predefined cutpoints
agd <- gtxplus1day \%>\%
  apply_cutpoints("evenson_children")

# Custom cutpoints

                     c("sedentary", "light", "moderate", "vigorous"))

agd <- gtxplus1day \%>\%
  apply_cutpoints("custom",
                  custom_cutpoints = my_cutpoints)
